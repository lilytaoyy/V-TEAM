The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national vaccine post-marketing surveillance program designed to detect adverse events that were not detected in smaller, pre-marketing studies. Using a dictionary for symptoms, we coded events as serious or non-serious and used frequency tables and proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) to compare reports among most frequently reported vaccines and adverse events between Jan 1, 2019 and March 26, 2021.
